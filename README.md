Solutions by Riley John Gibbs

## Running Python solutions

To run the code for a solution:

```bash
python -m solutions DAY [IMPLEMENTATION]
```

The Python package `solutions` will infer the input filepath for you based on `DAY`. That filepath will be `inputs/<DAY>.txt`, so make sure that the input file is saved there accordingly.

If not provided, `IMPLEMENTATION` defaults to `alpha`. This is the module that the solution functions are pulled from.

## Running Go solutions

To run the code for a Go solution, you'll need to supply the path to the input file:

```bash
go run gosolutions/dayXX/dayXX.go INPUTFILE
```
