# Inputs

All input files should go in here, but the input files themeselves are not committed to the repo.

In order for the Python solutions runner to correctly infer the input file, all input files should be in the format `XX.txt` where `XX` is the day expressed as a two-digit number, e.g. `05.txt`.
